HOW TO BUILD GLEAM
------------------

Using ant 
$ ant all

-or-

From the command line, if you don't have ant:
$ mkdir classes
$ javac -source 1.4 -target 1.4 -d classes gleam/Gleam.java gleam/*/*.java
$ jar cvfm Gleam.jar manifest bootstrap.scm -C classes .

In both cases you should get the Gleam.jar archive. To run it:

$ java -jar Gleam.jar
